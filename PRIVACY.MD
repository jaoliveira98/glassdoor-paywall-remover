# Privacy Policy for Glassdoor Sign‑In Wall Blocker

**Effective Date:** November 26, 2025

## Overview

This extension is a personal project created to improve the browsing experience on Glassdoor by removing sign‑in wall overlays and restoring normal scrolling. It runs entirely in your browser and does not communicate with any external servers.

## Data Collection

- This extension does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information.
- It does not access or transmit your browsing history, credentials, or communications.
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising code is included.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **Storage**: Used only to save your ON/OFF toggle preference so it persists between sessions.
- **Tabs**: Used only to reload the current Glassdoor tab when you change the toggle, ensuring the updated setting takes effect immediately.
- **Host permissions (`glassdoor.com`, `glassdoor.co.uk`)**: Required so the extension can detect and remove sign‑in overlays only on Glassdoor pages.

These permissions are strictly limited to the extension’s single purpose.

## Data Sharing

- No data is collected.
- No data is sold, transferred, or shared with third parties.
- No data is used for advertising, marketing, or profiling.

## Security
